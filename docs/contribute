#### FREE RANGE VHDL - how to contribute ####

FREE RANGE VHDL is written in Latex. The source code is available from: 
 https://github.com/fabriziotappero/Free-Range-VHDL-book

To help out with the book you can point out problems or suggestions 
by opning and issue at:
   https://github.com/fabriziotappero/Free-Range-VHDL-book

Alternatively, you can get the Latex source, edit it and sending me a
patch. If you like that please keep reading.

git (www.git-scm.com) is the version control system used to menage the 
content of this book. I personally use the Git Shell command line.

1) Get the latest latex version of the book from github:
    git clone https://github.com/fabriziotappero/Free-Range-VHDL-book.git
    cd Free-Range-VHDL-book-master

2) you can see the history of the latest version of the book with:
    gitk

4) Modify and save any file you want.

5) If you have Latex installed in your machine, use the command "compile" 
   and the command "clean" to compile and clean your final PDF. 
   check the status of your work with the command:
    git status

5) create a patch with the command:
    git diff > my_patch.patch

6) copy and paste the content of the patch file and an explanation of what
   you have done in a new issue at:
    https://github.com/fabriziotappero/Free-Range-VHDL-book

AN ALTERNATIVE AND MODERN WAY IS TO GENERATE A GITHUB PULL REQUEST.
